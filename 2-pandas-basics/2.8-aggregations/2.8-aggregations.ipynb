    "* `season`: The year of the NFL season. This reperesents the whole season, so regular season games that happen in January as well as playoff games will occur in the year after this number.\n",
    "* `conf`: The conference the team is in. This will be either AFC or NFC.\n",
    "* `division`: The division the team is in. This will be the value of conf followed by either East, North, South, or West.\n",
    "* `team`: The team.\n",
    "* `wins`: The number of games the team won in the regular season.\n",
    "* `losses`: The number of games the team lost in the regular season.\n",
    "* `ties`: The number of games the team tied in the regular season.\n",
    "* `pct`: The win rate of the team in the regular season. Equals (wins + 0.5 * ties) / (wins + losses + ties).\n",
    "* `div_rank`: This is where this team ranks compared to the other teams in the division based on regular season games only. Will be a number 1-4. If the teams have identical pct values, NFL tiebreakers are applied.\n",
    "* `scored`: The number of points the team has scored in regular season games.\n",
    "* `allowed`: The number of points the team has allowed to be scored on them in regular season games.\n",
    "* `net`: Net points scored in regular season games. Equals scored - allowed.\n",
    "* `sov`: As used in NFL tiebreakers, strength of victory, defined as the combined win rates for teams this team has beaten.\n",
    "* `sos`: As used in NFL tiebreakers, strength of schedule, defined as the combined win rates for teams this team has played.\n",
    "* `seed`: The seed earned by the team in its conference for playoff games. Is NA for teams which do not make the playoffs.\n",
    "* `playoff`: The outcome of the team's playoff run. Is NA for teams which do not make the playoffs, otherwise will be one of LostWC, LostDV, LostCC, LostSB, or WonSB.\n"
