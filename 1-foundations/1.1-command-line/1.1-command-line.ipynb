    "## What is a command shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "A command shell is a text-based interface to the computer. It allows you to\n",
    "enter commands and run programs. You can explore your folders, copy, move, and\n",
    "delete files, and run programs that process data, often creating new files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command shell is often called the \"terminal\" or \"command line\". While we'll\n",
    "do most of our work in Python, in Jupyter notebooks, it's useful to know a\n",
    "little about the command line, because:\n",
    "- It's the easiest way to move files around inside VS Code if they're not\n",
    "  inside the folder you have open in the file explorer.\n",
    "- Some data processing tasks are easier to do with command-line tools than with\n",
    "  Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a prompt?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a terminal, you'll see a prompt. It's a line of text that\n",
    "indicates that the terminal is ready to accept a command. The prompt usually\n",
    "includes some information about the computer and the current directory. For\n",
    "example, the prompt might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jessica@box:~$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `~` is a symbol that means \"home directory\". The prompt is telling you that\n",
    "you're in the home directory of the user `jessica` on the computer named `box`.\n",
    "When you're in a terminal, you can \"move around\" your folders just like opening\n",
    "different folders in the file explorer on windows or finder on mac. The `$`\n",
    "just means it's ready for you to type a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the prompt looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jessica@box:~/notebooks$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then you're in the `notebooks` folder inside the home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt can be heavily customized, and programmers tend to go to great\n",
    "lengths making their prompt look cool and informative, like you might decorate\n",
    "your home or desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands are all of the form `command-name arguments`. The `command-name` is\n",
    "the name of the program you want to run. The `arguments` are the inputs to the\n",
    "program. For example, the `ls` command lists the files in the current directory\n",
    "(remember, the shell has a \"current directory\" and you can move around).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a command, it will print information about what it's doing, or\n",
    "sometimes the command's job is just to take some input, change it, and print\n",
    "the output. Often, commands just won't output anything if they did what you\n",
    "asked correctly, or they'll print an error if you asked for something that\n",
    "doesn't make sense, or if they failed for some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can run the `ls` command to list the files in the current\n",
    "directory. You type `ls` and press Enter. Here's what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jessica@box:~$ ls\n",
    "Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's give it a try. Open a terminal by clicking the \"Terminal\" menu and\n",
    "selecting \"New Terminal\". Then type `ls` and press Enter. You should see a\n",
    "list of files and folders in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Many commands have options that change their behavior. Options are usually\n",
    "single letters, and they're written with a dash (`-`), or words, written with\n",
    "two dashes (`--`) with words separated by more dashes. Most options have a\n",
    "short form and a long form.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `ls` command has an option `-l` that makes it print more\n",

    "it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments are inputs to the command. For example, the `ls` command can take an\n",
    "argument that tells it which directory to list. If you run `ls 1-foundations`,\n",
    "it will list the files in the `1-foundations` directory. Try that now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tab completion\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're typing a command, you can press the Tab key to ask the shell to\n",
    "complete the command for you. If you type `ls 1-` and then press Tab, the shell\n",
    "will fill in the rest of the directory name for you, if it can. If there are\n",
    "multiple files or directories that start with `1-`, the shell will fill in as\n",
    "much as it can and then beep to let you know there's more than one option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try typing `ls 2-` and then pressing Tab. You should see it fill in the rest of\n",
    "`2-pandas-basics` for you, then you can press Enter to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also tab-complete command names. Try typing `pyth` and then pressing\n",
    "Tab. It should complete `python` for you. If you press Tab again, you'll get \n",

    "## Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell is like a file explorer, but you navigate it with commands instead of\n",
    "clicking on things. The `cd` command changes the current directory. For\n",
    "example, you can run `cd 1-foundations` to move into the `1-foundations`\n",
    "directory. Try it now: run `cd 1-foundations` and then run `ls` to see the\n",
    "files in that directory. Then run `ls` on one of the folders in\n",
    "`1-foundations`.\n",

    "You can also use `cd ..` to move up one directory. Try it now: run `cd ..` and\n",

    "\n",
    "The names `.` and `..` are special. `.` means \"this directory\" and `..` means\n",
    "\"the parent directory\". You can use them in any command that takes a file name\n",
    "or directory name. For example, you can run `ls .` which does the same thing as\n",
    "`ls`, or `ls ..` which lists the files in the parent directory. Try both now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folder separators\n",
    "\n",
    "In the shell, the `/` character is used to separate directories in a path. For\n",
    "example, the path `1-foundations/1.1-command-line` refers to the\n",
    "`1.1-command-line` directory inside the `1-foundations` directory. You can use\n",
    "this path in any command that takes a file name or directory name. For example,\n",
    "you can run `ls 1-foundations/1.1-command-line` to list the files in that\n",

    "directory.\n",

    "directory, and run `ls` to see the same files. Finally, from here, run `ls\n",
    "../../2-pandas-basics` to list the files in the `2-pandas-basics` directory, up\n",
    "two levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The home directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The `~` character is a shortcut for your home directory. You can use it in any\n",
    "command that takes a file name or directory name. For example, you can run `ls\n",
    "~` to list the files in your home directory. Try it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The tree command\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tree` command prints a tree of the files and directories in the current\n",
    "directory (or the directory you pass it). For example, you can run `tree` to\n",
