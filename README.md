# Data Analysis Problem Sets

This repository contains a sequence of problem sets for practicing working with
data in Python, with Jupyter, pandas, SQL, and a selection of visualization
tools. You can browse the syllabus and jump in wherever feels comfortable or
interesting. If you feel stuck in one area, maybe go back to a previous problem
set to practice.

## Chapter 1: Foundations

Working with command line tools, Jupyter notebooks, and Python.

### Problem Set 1.1: [Command line tools](./1-foundations/1.1-command-line/1.1-command-line.ipynb)

Learn to run commands and understand their output and errors, navigate
directories, move and copy files.

### Problem Set 1.2: [Jupyter and Python syntax](./1-foundations/1.2-jupyter-and-python-syntax/1.2-jupyter-and-python-syntax.ipynb)

Work with code cells in a notebook, reason about execution order and state in
Python variables, restarting your kernel.

Python statements, variables, if statements, loops, built in data structures.

### Problem Set 1.3: [Reading and viewing data](./1-foundations/1.3-reading-and-viewing-data/1.3-reading-and-viewing-data.ipynb)

Read something from a file, without Pandas, and explore it a bit.

### Problem Set 1.4: Advanced Python

**Note:** You may want to skip this and go straight to Chapter 2 if you're new
to programming. You won't need this until around Chapter 5 or 6.

Defining your own functions, modules, and classes.

## Chapter 2: Pandas basics

Learn the essential pandas operations you'll use frequently.

### Problem Set 2.1: [numpy arrays, Series, Dataframe](./2-pandas-basics/2.1-numpy-arrays-series-dataframe/2.1-numpy-arrays-series-dataframe.ipynb)

Learn about the core data structures in pandas:
- numpy arrays, which pandas builds on
- The 1-dimensional Series
- The 2-dimensional DataFrame

### Problem Set 2.2: [Reading CSV and JSON data](./2-pandas-basics/2.2-reading-csv-and-json-data/2.2-reading-csv-and-json-data.ipynb)

Learn how to read data from CSV and JSON files using pandas DataFrames.

### Problem Set 2.3: [Row and Column selection by location](./2-pandas-basics/2.3-row-and-column-selection-by-location/2.3-row-and-column-selection-by-location.ipynb)

Explore how to select specific rows and columns in a DataFrame.

### Problem Set 2.4: [Selection by Boolean columns](./2-pandas-basics/2.4-selection-by-boolean-columns/2.4-selection-by-boolean-columns.ipynb)

Explore how to select rows in a DataFrame based on a condition, rather than
their position (or label).

### Problem Set 2.5: [Indexes: loc[] vs iloc[]](./2-pandas-basics/2.5-indexes-loc-vs-iloc/2.5-indexes-loc-vs-iloc.ipynb)

Explore what "indexes" are in Series and DataFrames.

### Problem Set 2.6: [Accessors: dates, times, and strings](./2-pandas-basics/2.6-accessors-dates-times-and-strings/2.6-accessors-dates-times-and-strings.ipynb)

### Problem Set 2.7: [Combining tables: concat, merge, join](./2-pandas-basics/2.7-combining-tables-concat-merge-join/2.7-combining-tables-concat-merge-join.ipynb)

### Problem Set 2.8: [Aggregations](./2-pandas-basics/2.8-aggregations/2.8-aggregations.ipynb)

### Problem Set 2.9: [Pivot Tables and groupby](./2-pandas-basics/2.9-pivot-tables-and-groupby/2.9-pivot-tables-and-groupby.ipynb)

### Problem Set 2.10: [Immutable style](./2-pandas-basics/2.10-immutable-style/2.10-immutable-style.ipynb)

### Problem Set 2.11: [NaN and other gotchas](./2-pandas-basics/2.11-nan-and-other-gotchas/2.11-nan-and-other-gotchas.ipynb)
